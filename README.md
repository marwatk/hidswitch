# hidswitch

Software to turn ESP32-S3 devices into a USB switch using the HID protocol.

## Required Hardware

## Building

The `manage.sh` script can build (or show you how to build) the master and slave binaries and upload them to a device.
It relies on publishing a serial port via TCP for talking to the ESP32-S3s.
